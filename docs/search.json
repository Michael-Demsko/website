Use rapid prototyping to test ideas early in the process.\n\n\nThe Role of Empathy\nCreative thinking in product design isn’t just about coming up with new ideas—it’s also about understanding the end user’s needs. Empathy mapping and user personas can help ensure that the creative ideas are grounded in real-world needs and desires.\n```{r} # Here is a simple code example to illustrate how R can be used to simulate ideas: set.seed(42) ideas &lt;- sample(c(“Empathy”, “Innovation”, “Prototyping”, “Brainstorming”), 10, replace = TRUE) table(ideas)"
